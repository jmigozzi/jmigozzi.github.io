## Abstract

Sports' geography provides a new means of analysing and understanding South African urban space. In Cape Town, school rugby, deeply embedded in and influenced by the city and the country's political history, highlights the social dynamics, divides, and inequalities of contemporary South African society. Though school rugby contributes to enshrining and renewing racial and social segregation, it also nurtures new urban practices and social interactions. From its spatialities, structure, its actors and their network, emerge sports territories that articulate segregation and desegregation processes within the post-apartheid city
