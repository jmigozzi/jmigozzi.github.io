With the 2023 Rugby World Cup that just started, I decided to combine two passions of mine: geography and rugby - with a bit of a computational twist.

Sourcing data from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Rugby_World_Cup_squads), I collected the list of all players participating in the world cup, representing a total of 20 teams. Replicating what I did for the French team in a [previous post](https://jmigozzi.github.io/posts/2009-09-13-xvdefrance/), I extracted - when available - the place and country of birth.

The result is this simple [interactive website](https://jmigozzi.github.io/rwcsquads2023/), showing how deeply transnational the making of international teams is now, since rugby became a professional sport in the late 1990s.  

You can explore the composition of each team or identify which country is the most represented across the 20 teams.


The script and the data can be accessed in this [repository](https://github.com/jmigozzi/rwcsquads2023).
