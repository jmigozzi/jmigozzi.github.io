I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html/) at the University of Oxford. 

At the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology, my work articulates two main questions:

- How are housing and financial markets transformed by digital technologies?
- How are urban segregation and social inequalities affected by these digital transformations?

Methodologically, I combine qualitative and ethnographic research with computational tools, spatial analysis and mapping, mostly with R and QGIS.


My current project, funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/), investigates the emergence of real estate platforms in the South African housing market. More generally, I am interested in understanding how recent industries such as PropTech and FinTech reshape the social and spatial structures of cities and markets. 

At Oxford, I previously worked on the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography. Our team authored the first *[Atlas of Finance](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/projects/success-stories/all/atlas-maps-global-financial-network)*, forthcoming at Yale University Press in 2024. From 2017 to 2021, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [the Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) in Paris.


Most of my curriculum took place in France. I graduated from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) as a student fellow (*élève normalien*) and passed the *agrégation* of geography. I then earned my PhD from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). In 2021, my [ dissertation](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020GRALH007) was awarded the national [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) and the national [Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/).

I am an Associate Member of [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, and a Research Associate at the Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), where I was a doctoral candidate. Since 2023, I'm an early career representative at the [FinGeo Network](https://www.fingeo.net/).

I occasionally write and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby - a personal passion that originally brought me to South Africa.
