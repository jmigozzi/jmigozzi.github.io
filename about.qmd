**Research interests**

My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology.

My ongoing research investigates how digital technologies transform  real estate and finance, reshaping urban housing markets in the Global South. I am particularly interested in the PropTech and FinTech industries, to analyze how real estate and financial technologies renew mechanisms of segregation and inequalities. 

Methodologically, my work combines qualitative and ethnographic research with computational tools, spatial analysis and mapping.

My current project is funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) and focuses on real estate platforms in South Africa.

I occasionally [write](https://jmigozzi.github.io/posts.html#category=Rugby) and talk about rugby.

As a Research Associate in Finance and Geography, I was previously part of the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" led by Professor Dariusz Wójcik. Our team authored the first Atlas of Finance, to be published by Yale University Press in 2024.

I did most of my curriculum in France. I earned my MA from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes. Prior to joining Oxford, I worked as a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.

I am a Research Associate at the Research Labs [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), an Associate Member of the [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), and a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town.
