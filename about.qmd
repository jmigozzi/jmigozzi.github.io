**Research interests**

My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology.

I investigate how digital technologies transform real estate and finance, reshape urban housing markets in the Global South, and renew mechanisms of segregation and inequalities. More specifically, I am particularly interested in studying the PropTech and FinTech industries, and their consequences for cities and markets from a social, political and economical perspective.

Methodologically, my work combines qualitative and ethnographic research with computational tools, spatial analysis and mapping.

My current project is funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) and focuses on real estate platforms in South Africa.

I occasionally [write](https://jmigozzi.github.io/posts.html#category=Rugby) and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby.


**Education and Affiliations**

As a Research Associate in Finance and Geography, I was previously part of the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" led by Professor Dariusz Wójcik. Our team authored the first Atlas of Finance, forthcoming at Yale University Press in 2024.

I am Associate Member of the [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), and a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town. Since 2023, I'm also an early career representative at the [FinGeo Network](https://www.fingeo.net/).

Most of my curriculum took place in France. I earned my MA from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes. Prior to joining Oxford, I worked as a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. I remain a Research Associate at the Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), where I was a doctoral candidate.
