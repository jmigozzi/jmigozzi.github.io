My research examines the geography and political economy of digital capitalism, focusing on how data, algorithms, and platforms reshape markets and inequalities. I employ mixed methods, including ethnographic fieldwork, expert interviews, spatial analysis, and computational social science.

The primary focus of my research is to analyse how real estate technologies, commonly referred to as PropTech, are transforming housing markets and renewing patterns of stratification and segregation. This work specifically examines South Africa, where I have been undertaking in-depth fieldwork since 2015. This research is currently funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/").

The secondary focus investigates the transformative impact of digitisation on financial markets, centres, and firms, with particular emphasis on FinTech ecosystems, private equity and venture capital, especially within emerging and postcolonial economies.

I previously worked as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography on the ERC project titled [Cities in Global Financial Networks](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/681337) at Oxford University (2021-2022). I served as a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris (2017-2021). I held visiting positions at the African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town, and at the Department of Sociology at UC Berkeley. I am an early-career representative at the [Global Network on Financial Geography](https://www.fingeo.net/).

The majority of my education took place in France. I am a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, where I was  a student fellow (*éleve normalien*), obtained my Master's degree in Geography & Planning, and passed the [agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agr%C3%A9gation). I then completed my PhD at the University of Grenoble Alpes and at the research centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/) in Paris, where I remain a Research Associate. My dissertation received two national awards: the [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](https://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html?lang=en) and the [Best Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/). 

I really love fictions - especially plays - and [rugby](https://jmigozzi.github.io/rwcsquads2023/).
