<br>

From September 2022, I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) in the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford.

My ongoing research investigates how digital technologies transform the real estate and finance industries, create global real estate networks and reshape urban housing markets, focusing on South Africa and the Global South.

I am particularly interested in credit scoring, real estate platforms (PropTech) and FinTech, and how such technologies renew patterns of urban segregation and wealth inequalities.

My research involves mixed methods framework that combines in-depth fieldwork based on expert interviews and participant-observation with computational analysis and mapping, using open source tools such as R or QGIS.

I also occasionally write or talk about rugby.

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.
