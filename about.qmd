<br>

I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) in the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford.

My ongoing research investigates how digital technologies transform the real estate and finance industries to reshape urban housing markets. I am particularly interested in understanding how credit scoring, real estate platforms (PropTech), and FinTech interact with and renew patterns and mechanisms of segregation and inequalities.

Most of my work focuses on post-apartheid South Africa.

Through a mixed methods framework, I combine in-depth fieldwork based on expert interviews and participant-observation with computational and spatial analysis, using open source tools such as R or QGIS.

I also occasionally write or talk about rugby.


**Appointments and Education**

As a Research Associate in Finance and Geography, I was previously part of the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" led by Professor Dariusz Wójcik. Our team authored the first Atlas of Finance, to be published by Yale University Press in 2024.

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.

I earned my MA from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes.
