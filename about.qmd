<br>

From September 2022, I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) in the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford.

My ongoing research investigates how digital technologies transform the real estate and finance industries, creating global real estate networks and reshaping urban housing markets, focusing on South Africa.

I am particularly interested in the topics of credit scoring, real estate platforms (PropTech) and FinTech, and issues of urban segregation and inequalities.

My research involves mixed methods framework that combines in-depth fieldwork based on expert interviews and participant-observation with computational analysis and mapping, using open source tools such as R or QGIS.

**Appointments and Education**

As a Research Associate in Finance and Geography, I was previously part of the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" led by Professor Dariusz Wójcik. Our team authored the first Atlas of Finance, to be published by Yale University Press in 2024.

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I was a lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.

I earned my MA from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes.
