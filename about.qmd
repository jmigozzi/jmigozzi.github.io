My research explores how digital capitalism reshapes markets and inequalities, integrating ethnographic fieldwork, spatial analysis, and computational social science.

The primary focus of my research analyzes how the digitization of real estate markets is renewing patterns of social stratification and urban segregation in post-apartheid South Africa.

The second focus examines how digitization is transforming financial markets and financial centers, particularly in emerging and postcolonial economies.

I previously worked as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography at Oxford University on the ERC project titled"[Cities in Global Financial Networks](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/681337) (2021-2022) Before my time at Oxford, I served as a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris (2017-2021). I held visiting visiting positions at the African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town. I am an early-career representative at the [Global Network on Financial Geography](https://www.fingeo.net/). 

The majority of my education took place in France. I have a Master's degree in Geography and Planning from the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, where I was a student fellow. I then earned a PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes, where my dissertation received two national awards: the [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](https://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html?lang=en) and the [Best Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/). 

I really love fictions - especially plays - and [rugby](https://jmigozzi.github.io/rwcsquads2023/).
