As from September 2022, I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) in the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford.

My current research project investigates the rise of real estate technologies, also known as PropTech, in South Africa, through a comparison of housing markets in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

My research involves a mixed methods framework that combines fieldwork based on interviews and participant-observation with computational analysis and mapping, relying on open source tools such as R or QGIS.

As a Research Associate in Finance and Geography at Oxford, I was previously part of the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" led by Professor Dariusz Wójcik. Our team authored the first Atlas of Finance, to be published by Yale University Press in 2023.

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the [Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris](https://www.ens.psl.eu/).

I earned my MA in Geography from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and my Ph.D. from the University of Grenoble Alpes.

My PhD dissertation examined how the digitalization of the real estate market enabled the financialization of housing and renewed patterns of stratification and urban segregation across Cape Town, in post-apartheid South Africa.

This [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03121350) was awarded two national awards: the 2021 [National Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) by the PUCA-APERAU-Caisse des Dépôts, and the 2021 [National Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/) by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG). It also received a Special mention of the jury for the 2021 [Humanities and social sciences PSL Dissertation Prize](https://psl.eu/en/news/winners-2021-humanities-and-social-sciences-shs-psl-dissertation-prize).

I am a Research Associate at the Research Labs [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/) and [PACTE](https://www.pacte-grenoble.fr/en), an Associate Member of the [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), and a regular Visiting Researcher of the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town.

I also occasionally write - and tweet - about rugby.
