I am an economic and urban geographer. Currently, I'm an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html/) at the University of Oxford. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology to examine how platform capitalism reshapes cities and markets. More specifically, I analyse how financial services and real estate markets, as mediated by digital technologies, intersect with social and spatial inequalities, focusing on South Africa. 

My work combines qualitative and ethnographic research with computational social science, spatial analysis, and data visualization, and seeks to question theoretical and empirical boundaries between the Global North and the Global South.


My current project, funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/), investigates how digital technologies and industries such as PropTech, FinTech and InsurTech reconfigure value chains and urban housing markets in South Africa. 


At Oxford, I previously worked on the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/681337)" as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography. I co-authored the first *[Atlas of Finance](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/projects/success-stories/all/atlas-maps-global-financial-network)*, forthcoming at Yale University Press in 2024. From 2017 to 2021, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [the Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) in Paris.


I hold a MA in Geography from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), where I was as a student fellow (*élève normalien*) and obtained the *[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agr%C3%A9gation)* of geography. I earned my PhD from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). In 2021, my [dissertation](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020GRALH007) was awarded both the national [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) and the national [Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/).


I am an Associate Member of [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, and a Research Associate at the Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), where I was a doctoral candidate.

I occasionally write and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby - a passion that originally brought me to South Africa.
