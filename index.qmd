I am an economic and urban geographer. I am currently an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the University of Oxford, and a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Sociology and the [Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.

At the intersection of financial geography, urban studies, and economic sociology, my research examines the geography of digital capitalism to understand how digital technologies reshape value chains, organizational practices, and inequalities.

Focusing on South Africa, my ongoing research project investigates how housing markets are transformed by the platform economy, and what this convergence between financial capital and digital technologies entails for urban segregation and wealth inequalities in cities profoundly shaped by racial capitalism.

I use mixed-methods that combine ethnographic fieldwork with spatial data science, leveraging computational social science, data visualization, and expert interviews. 

I am a coauthor of the *[Atlas of Finance](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300253054/atlas-of-finance/)*, published by Yale University Press. At Oxford, I was previously a Research Associate in Finance and Geography on the ERC-funded project "Cities in Global Financial Networks". From 2017 to 2021 I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.

Before that, I studied at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, where I majored in Geography and Social Sciences. I earned my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes. My dissertation received two national awards: the Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies, from the Ministries of Research, Culture, and Ecological Transition ; the Best Dissertation Award, from the French National Geographical Committee.

I am an Associate Member of St Peter's College at Oxford University, a regular Visiting Scholar at the African Centre for Cities, at the University of Cape Town, an Early Career Representative
at the [Global Network on Financial Geography](https://www.fingeo.net/) Committee, and a Research Associate at the Research Lab [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/) (CNRS).

I occasionally write and talk about the [geography of rugby](https://jmigozzi.github.io/rwcsquads2023/).
