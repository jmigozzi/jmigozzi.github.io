I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the University of Oxford.

As an economic geographer, my research interests lie at the intersection of financial geography, urban studies and economic sociology.

My ongoing research investigates how digital technologies transform the real estate and finance industries, create global real estate networks, and reshape urban housing markets, focusing on South Africa.

In April 2023, I'm co-organizing an international masterclass on "Digital technologies in the African city" in Cape Town. Check it [out](https://jmigozzi.github.io/masterclass/)!
