I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html/) at the University of Oxford. In 2024-2025, I will be a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Sociology at UC Berkeley.

My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology, focusing on two main research questions:

- How are real estate and financial markets transformed by digital technologies?
- How are urban housing markets and social inequalities affected by these digital transformations?

Methodologically, I combine qualitative and ethnographic research with computational social science, spatial analysis, data vizualisation, and mapping.


My current project, funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/), investigates how real estate platforms reconfigure value chains and organizational structures across the South African housing market. More generally, I'm interested in recent industries such as PropTech and FinTech, and how these leverage and reshape the social and spatial structures of cities and markets, focusing on emerging economies to examine how platform capitalism questions theoretical and empirical boundaries between the Global North and the Global South.


At Oxford, I previously worked on the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/681337)" as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography. Our team authored the first *[Atlas of Finance](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/projects/success-stories/all/atlas-maps-global-financial-network)*, forthcoming at Yale University Press in 2024. From 2017 to 2021, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [the Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) in Paris.


I hold a MA in Geography from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), where I was as a student fellow (*élève normalien*) and passed the *agrégation* of geography. I earned my PhD from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). In 2021, my [ dissertation](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020GRALH007) was awarded the national [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) and the national [Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/).



I am an Associate Member of [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, and a Research Associate at the Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), where I was a doctoral candidate.

I occasionally write and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby - a passion that originally brought me to South Africa.
