I am an economic and urban geographer. Currently, I'm an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html/) at the University of Oxford. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography and urban studies. I examine how platform capitalism reshapes cities and markets in emerging economies, questioning theoretical boundaries and empirical connections between the Global North and the Global South.

My ongoing research analyses how financial and housing markets, as mediated by digital technologies, intersect with social and spatial inequalities, focusing on South Africa and Cape Town, a post-apartheid and emerging global city dubbed as the "Silicon Cape" of Africa. I explore how financial capital and property technologies shape urban space and social change, by interrogating the performative effects of data, algorithms and platforms over people and places.

My current project, funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/), investigates how digital ecosystems across the PropTech, FinTech and InsurTech industries reconfigure value chains and transform urban housing markets in South Africa. 

My work combines qualitative and quantitative research to explain and map processes of market-making, urban change and economic transformations. I use long-term ethnographic fieldwork (expert interviews, participant-observation) and spatial data science, leveraging computational tools, spatial analysis, and data vizualisation.


At Oxford, I previously worked on the ERC-funded project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/681337)" as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography, analyzing how the rise of digital technologies transform financial centres and financial markets. I co-authored the first *[Atlas of Finance](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/projects/success-stories/all/atlas-maps-global-financial-network)*, forthcoming at Yale University Press in 2024. From 2017 to 2021, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [the Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en) in Paris.


I am a former student of the [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), where I completed my MA in Geography and obtained the *[agrégation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agr%C3%A9gation)* of geography. I hold a PhD from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). In 2021, my [dissertation](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020GRALH007) was awarded both the national [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) and the national [Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/).


I am an Associate Member of [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/), a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Centre for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, and a Research Associate at the CNRS Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/).

I occasionally write and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby - a passion that originally brought me to South Africa.
