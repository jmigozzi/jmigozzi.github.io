My [PhD dissertation](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03121350) was awarded two national prizes: 

- the 2021 [National Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html) by the PUCA-APERAU-Caisse des Dépôts;

- the 2021 [National Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/) by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG). 

The thesis also received a Special mention of the jury for the 2021 [Humanities and social sciences PSL Dissertation Prize](https://psl.eu/en/news/winners-2021-humanities-and-social-sciences-shs-psl-dissertation-prize).

In this work, I demonstrated how the digitalization of the real estate industry driven by credit scoring and real estate platforms reshaped the mortgage and rental markets and enabled the financialization of housing, thereby renewing patterns of stratification and urban segregation across Cape Town, a post-apartheid and emerging city of the Global South.

To that end, I conducted 18 months of fieldwork among market professionals. In parallel, I sourced deeds data to construct a database of 900,000 residential sales covering the Cape Town metropolitan area from 1984 to 2017, and assembled longitudinal census data at the neighborhood level.
