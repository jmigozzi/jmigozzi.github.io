I use a mixed method that combines in-depth field research conducted among key market players with an analysis of georeferenced residential transactions. Connecting financial and urban geography, the article retraces the institutional and social anatomy of financialization. I demonstrate how financialization unfolds in metropolitan areas through the classification of people and the selection of spaces, by staying away from the urban poor, and instead incorporating the middle- and upper-income sections of society. In that regard, the article unpacks the urban and class structures of housing financialization in South Africa, which challenges narratives from the urban Global North. Two market segments drive financialization in South Africa: the rental market, which became a new financial frontier with the emergence of corporate landlords; and the owner-occupied market, with the rise of the mortgage industry and the limited implementation of securitization, underpinned by highly restrictive lending practices. In both segments, financial institutions and corporate landlords rely on credit scoring to classify and select tenants or mortgage beneficiaries; they target specific areas within the post-apartheid city to develop residential portfolios and allocate mortgages.\nPublished in Housing Policy Debate."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper advances a research agenda on how asset-based welfare policies, residential market volatility, stratified accumulation and vulnerability impinge upon the geography of inequality in property markets. Since the mid-1990s, housing prices have increased faster than the income of buyers, becoming a driver of social polarisation and household vulnerability. Few studies have however explicitly linked socio-spatial inequality to asset capitalisation, instability and vulnerability in residential housing markets. We employ an empirically-grounded investigation of the factors driving and reinforcing these dynamics, what we conceptualise as a feedback loop mediating particular housing finance regimes. Drawing on three French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Avignon) our study develops a comparative framework to interpret the relational effects of price, equity and homeowner vulnerability on the production of inequality across different geographical scales. Our approach puts into conversation debates concerning housing markets, social inequality, and ordinary financialisation in the period since the Global Financial Crisis.\nPublished in Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie."

    "text": "Abstract\nAs emerging and postcolonial cities of the Global South, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, Nairobi and Cape Town share some common trends with regards to local real estate market dynamics. The spectacular increase of real estate prices had clear implications for urban national parks in these cities: the land and resources provided by the park are claimed by the urban poor, in the form of informal settlements and squatting strategies, while the park, as a major amenity and a potential reserve of land, attracted developers and investors. But despite the rise of property values and the intensity of urban change, these cities remain quite marginalised from the large scholarship on how environmental amenities influence market and price dynamics. Using primary and secondary data, this chapter deploys quantitative methodologies for mapping and tracing the spatial dynamics of housing prices, with a focus on Cape Town and Mumbai. Analysing local market configurations, both in terms of supply and demand, this chapter investigates the interweaving of the park within the housing market: we discuss the making of the park as an influential environmental amenity by analysing the marketing strategies, the narratives and the discourses displayed by local market actors, and investigate the role of the park in the determination of property prices. In the context of urban growth and rising property prices, market forces turn urban national parks into a land of opportunity, both for profit-oriented developers and city-dwellers aspiring to access housing, either through the formal or informal market channels. Findings highlight how the interplay of market forces and residential contexts led to a social and spatial process of homogenisation in Cape Town and to a process of differentiation in Mumbai: the construction of environmental amenities and their incorporation into the housing market are deeply structured on the local patterns of social stratification and market configurations."

    "text": "Abstract\nSince 1983, no non-self-governing island connected to a (neo-) colonial European or American metropole has acquired full Westphalian sovereignty and these islands continue to operate within constitutional frameworks that connect them to these metropoles. Large majorities in referendums on several of these islands have rejected full sovereignty. This paper opens with a review of the essential elements of the concept of sovereignty in a historical and global context, before studying how sovereignty is unfolding in new forms in non-self-governing islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean. As a case study, an analysis is presented of how pro-France (loyaliste) and pro-independence (indépendantiste) parties in New Caledonia are negotiating sovereignty with France. Evidence is given of how these New Caledonian parties are creatively using classic Westphalian signifiers of sovereignty normally reserved for sovereign states such as flags, diplomatic representations and international treaties, while still negotiating New Caledonia’s sovereignty with France. This suggests that in contrast to Westphalian sovereignty, a unique ‘Islandian’ concept of sovereignty is emerging. Islands that are not sovereign in a Westphalian sense can creatively disassemble and reassemble signifiers of Westphalian sovereignty to strengthen their continuous negotiations with their metropoles and their neighbours.\nPublished in Asia Pacific Viewpoint."

    "text": "Abstract\nRugby appears to be a valuable topic allowing reading and analyzing the South African notions of space and society. Its deep cultural impact and the attachment — almost religious — that a section of the population of the country has for this sport establish it as a true symbol fraught with the social stakes of the South African nation. As a highly political topic and a particularly interesting focus for the press, rugby is discussed by elected representatives and gives rise to deep controversies over points such as skin-colour or inequalities, which are major issues for the future of the country. After 150 years of political appropriation, it has been pushed to the rank of most valuable sport for the White Afrikaner community and raises the tricky issue of identity in the context of a rainbow nation that hesitates between acknowledging the Black and coloured cultures and searching for an identification of all communities to the South African nation through sport. Rugby, that played a part in the division among the South African people, is now a particularly important element that brings to light the stakes of transformation and development that trouble the country. Indeed, discrimination, economic and social inequalities and strong oppositions that have their roots in the past and the apartheid can be found today in rugby. Sport, and firstly rugby because of the symbolism that surrounds it, can be seen as a key-sector for development and recovery policies that not only have to remedy inequality through support and practice, especially in historically disadvantaged communities, but also have to transform the picture of rugby in order to turn it into the sport of all South Africans.\nPublished in Les Cahiers d’Outre-Mer."

    "text": "Abstract\nPrice inflation has outbalanced the income of residents and buyers in major post-industrial city-regions, and real estate has become an important driver of these inequalities. In a context of a resilient inflation of home values during the last two decades in the greater Paris Region, it is critical to examine housing price dynamics to get a better understanding of socioeconomic segregation. This paper aims at presenting spatial analysis of the dynamics of segregation pertaining to inflation, analyzing price and sellers and buyers data. Using interpolation techniques and multivariate analysis, the paper presents a spatial analysis of property-level data from the Paris Chamber of Notaries (1996-2012) in a GIS (159,000 transactions in suburban areas, single family homes only). Multivariate analysis capture price change and local trajectories of occupational status, i.e. changes in balance between inward and outward flows of sellers and buyers. We adopt a method that fits the fragmented spatial patterns of suburbanization. To do so, we remove the spatial bias by means of a regular 1-km spatial grid, interpolating the variables within it, using a time-distance matrix. The main results are threefold. We document the spatial patterns of professionalization (a rise of executives, intermediate occupation and employees) to describe the main trends of inward mobility in property ownership in suburbs, offsetting the outward mobility of retired persons. Second, neighborhood trajectories are related the diverging patterns of appreciation, between local contexts of accumulation with a growth of residential prices, and suburbs with declining trends. The maturity of suburbanization yields a diversified structure of segregation between the social groups, that do not simply oppose executives vs. blue collar suburbs. A follow-up research agenda is finally outlined.\nPublished in PLOS One."
