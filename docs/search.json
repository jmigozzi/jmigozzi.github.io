    "text": "Abstract\nPrice inflation has outbalanced the income of residents and buyers in major post-industrial city-regions, and real estate has become an important driver of these inequalities. In a context of a resilient inflation of home values during the last two decades in the greater Paris Region, it is critical to examine housing price dynamics to get a better understanding of socioeconomic segregation. This paper aims at presenting spatial analysis of the dynamics of segregation pertaining to inflation, analyzing price and sellers and buyers data. Using interpolation techniques and multivariate analysis, the paper presents a spatial analysis of property-level data from the Paris Chamber of Notaries (1996-2012) in a GIS (159,000 transactions in suburban areas, single family homes only). Multivariate analysis capture price change and local trajectories of occupational status, i.e. changes in balance between inward and outward flows of sellers and buyers. We adopt a method that fits the fragmented spatial patterns of suburbanization. To do so, we remove the spatial bias by means of a regular 1-km spatial grid, interpolating the variables within it, using a time-distance matrix. The main results are threefold. We document the spatial patterns of professionalization (a rise of executives, intermediate occupation and employees) to describe the main trends of inward mobility in property ownership in suburbs, offsetting the outward mobility of retired persons. Second, neighborhood trajectories are related the diverging patterns of appreciation, between local contexts of accumulation with a growth of residential prices, and suburbs with declining trends. The maturity of suburbanization yields a diversified structure of segregation between the social groups, that do not simply oppose executives vs. blue collar suburbs. A follow-up research agenda is finally outlined.\nPublished in PLOS One."

In Cape Town, school rugby, deeply embedded in and influenced by the city and the country’s political history, highlights the social dynamics, divides, and inequalities of contemporary South African society. Though school rugby contributes to enshrining and renewing racial and social segregation, it also nurtures new urban practices and social interactions. From its spatialities, structure, its actors and their network, emerge sports territories that articulate segregation and desegregation processes within the post-apartheid city\nPublished in M@ppemonde."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis article examines how racial capitalism intersects with platform capitalism through the rise of rental platforms and corporate landlords in the post-apartheid housing market. Combining 18 months of fieldwork in Cape Town with the spatial analysis of sales and longitudinal census data, I demonstrate how rental platforms enabled the consolidation of the private rental sector and the emergence of corporate landlords through the classification of tenants centered upon credit scoring. To automate tenant screening solutions, rental platforms leveraged and extended the information dragnet knitted by credit bureaus. This dragnet of unprecedented depth and volume is built upon the infrastructures and devices that enabled the for-profit, racial classification of people, housing and neighborhoods during colonialism and apartheid, notably ID numbers. In the context of racialized indebtedness and housing inequalities engineered by racial property regimes, the use of platforms to sort the “good” from the “bad” tenant and manage rental portfolios shifts mechanisms of segregation and reproduces racialized patterns of capital accumulation across the post-apartheid city. The article argues that rental platforms extend the extractive logic of racial capitalism through two joint rentier mechanisms: the transformation of rental housing into a new asset class; the extraction and assetization of rental data."

    "text": "Abstract\nAs emerging and postcolonial cities of the Global South, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, Nairobi and Cape Town share some common trends with regards to local real estate market dynamics. The spectacular increase of real estate prices had clear implications for urban national parks in these cities: the land and resources provided by the park are claimed by the urban poor, in the form of informal settlements and squatting strategies, while the park, as a major amenity and a potential reserve of land, attracted developers and investors. But despite the rise of property values and the intensity of urban change, these cities remain quite marginalised from the large scholarship on how environmental amenities influence market and price dynamics. Using primary and secondary data, this chapter deploys quantitative methodologies for mapping and tracing the spatial dynamics of housing prices, with a focus on Cape Town and Mumbai. Analysing local market configurations, both in terms of supply and demand, this chapter investigates the interweaving of the park within the housing market: we discuss the making of the park as an influential environmental amenity by analysing the marketing strategies, the narratives and the discourses displayed by local market actors, and investigate the role of the park in the determination of property prices. In the context of urban growth and rising property prices, market forces turn urban national parks into a land of opportunity, both for profit-oriented developers and city-dwellers aspiring to access housing, either through the formal or informal market channels. Findings highlight how the interplay of market forces and residential contexts led to a social and spatial process of homogenisation in Cape Town and to a process of differentiation in Mumbai: the construction of environmental amenities and their incorporation into the housing market are deeply structured on the local patterns of social stratification and market configurations."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent advancements in the global production networks (GPN) literature seek to better emphasise the role of finance by identifying where and how global financial networks (GFNs) intersect with GPNs. Financial centres operate as key sites for articulating financial convergence, understood as the merging of financial and non-financial sectors enacted by cross-sectoral investments. Yet, how such entanglement both feeds upon and impacts inter-city networks, affecting metropolitan hierarchies, remains largely overlooked. Using a novel dataset of 12,147 inter-sectoral, cross-border and domestic merger and acquisition (M&As) deals involving finance and insurance firms throughout the period of 2000-2020, this paper unpacks the sectoral dynamics that underpin the intersection of GFNs with GPNs at the city level in India, the 5th largest economy in the world. Our longitudinal and multiscalar analysis demonstrates how uneven patterns of financial convergence, structured around the rising entanglement between finance and IT, have reshaped inter-city networks and affected the landscape of financial centres in India. If Mumbai remains India’s financial capital, Bangalore and New Delhi gained power in domestic and international flows, well ahead of other Indian cities. The paper emphasizes how the IT firms, as recipient of transnational investments, and central governments, through direct interventions and state-hybrid investors, operate as key drivers in articulating GFNs with GPNs through inter-city networks, changing urban geographies of finance, raising methodological and conceptual questions for future research on financial geography."

Digitalization and financialization of the housing market in Cape Town: stratification & segregation in the emerging global city”, was awarded two national prizes:\n\nthe 2021 Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies by the PUCA-APERAU-Caisse des Dépôts;\nthe 2021 Dissertation Award in Geography by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG).\n\nThe thesis also received a Special mention of the jury for the 2021 Humanities and social sciences PSL Dissertation Prize.\nIn this work, I demonstrated how the digitalization of the real estate industry structured around the implementation of credit scoring and the rise of real estate platforms reshaped the functioning of the housing market, enabling a selective financialization of housing across the mortgage market and the private rental sector. These market reconfigurations have renewed mechanisms and patterns of social stratification and urban segregation in Cape Town, a post-apartheid and emerging city of the Global South.\nTo investigate the housing market, I conducted 18 months of fieldwork among the real estate industry, from real estate agents to mortgage lenders, from corporate investors to ordinary households. I used expert interviews and ethnographic methods. In parallel, In order to analyze how the spatial dynamics of price and credit influence the evolution of income-based and racial segregation, I sourced raw deeds data to build a database of 900,000 geolocated sales, covering the metro area from 1984 to 2017, and digitally reconstructed the zoning of apartheid. This database was cross-analysed with longitudinal census data. I used open source tools such as R and QGIS to perform computational and spatial analysis."

Connecting financial and urban geography, the article retraces the institutional and social anatomy of financialization. I demonstrate how financialization unfolds in metropolitan areas through the classification of people and the selection of spaces, by staying away from the urban poor, and instead incorporating the middle- and upper-income sections of society. In that regard, the article unpacks the urban and class structures of housing financialization in South Africa, which challenges narratives from the urban Global North. Two market segments drive financialization in South Africa: the rental market, which became a new financial frontier with the emergence of corporate landlords; and the owner-occupied market, with the rise of the mortgage industry and the limited implementation of securitization, underpinned by highly restrictive lending practices. In both segments, financial institutions and corporate landlords rely on credit scoring to classify and select tenants or mortgage beneficiaries; they target specific areas within the post-apartheid city to develop residential portfolios and allocate mortgages."

Recent advancements in the global production networks (GPNs) literature seek to better emphasize the role of finance by identifying where and how global financial networks (GFNs) intersect with GPNs. Financial centers (FCs) operate as key sites for articulating financial convergence, understood as the merging of financial and nonfinancial sectors enacted by cross-sectoral investments. Yet, how such entanglement both feeds on and impacts intercity networks, affecting metropolitan hierarchies, remains largely overlooked. Using a novel data set of 12,147 intersectoral, cross-border and domestic merger and acquisition deals involving finance and insurance firms throughout the period of 2000–20, this article unpacks the sectoral dynamics that underpin the intersection of GFNs with GPNs at the city level in India, the fifth largest economy in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper advances a research agenda on how asset-based welfare policies, residential market volatility, stratified accumulation and vulnerability impinge upon the geography of inequality in property markets. Since the mid-1990s, housing prices have increased faster than the income of buyers, becoming a driver of social polarisation and household vulnerability. Few studies have however explicitly linked socio-spatial inequality to asset capitalisation, instability and vulnerability in residential housing markets. We employ an empirically-grounded investigation of the factors driving and reinforcing these dynamics, what we conceptualise as a feedback loop mediating particular housing finance regimes. Drawing on three French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Avignon) our study develops a comparative framework to interpret the relational effects of price, equity and homeowner vulnerability on the production of inequality across different geographical scales. Our approach puts into conversation debates concerning housing markets, social inequality, and ordinary financialisation in the period since the Global Financial Crisis."

Using a financial ecology approach, we combine quantitative data on firm creation and funding with insights from corporate interviews to unpack and examine the key elements of the Indian FinTech ecosystem. At the national scale, our results highlight how the export-oriented ICT sector, the implantation of large-scale, open digital infrastructures and enabling regulatory frameworks have enabled and shaped the growth of FinTech as a state-supported, tech-driven “Tech-Fin-State” ecosystem. At a city scale, the paper demonstrates how FinTech transforms India’s financial geography in two directions. First, locational patterns and investment networks have established New Delhi and Bangalore as international FinTech hubs, ahead of Mumbai. Second, the re-intermediation of finance by FinTech firms should be understood as the connection between the two distinct yet complementary ecosystems of Bangalore, India’s FinTech capital, and Mumbai, the incumbent financial capital, while advancing regional integration beyond India."

Large majorities in referendums on several of these islands have rejected full sovereignty. This paper opens with a review of the essential elements of the concept of sovereignty in a historical and global context, before studying how sovereignty is unfolding in new forms in non-self-governing islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean. As a case study, an analysis is presented of how pro-France (loyaliste) and pro-independence (indépendantiste) parties in New Caledonia are negotiating sovereignty with France. Evidence is given of how these New Caledonian parties are creatively using classic Westphalian signifiers of sovereignty normally reserved for sovereign states such as flags, diplomatic representations and international treaties, while still negotiating New Caledonia’s sovereignty with France. This suggests that in contrast to Westphalian sovereignty, a unique ‘Islandian’ concept of sovereignty is emerging. Islands that are not sovereign in a Westphalian sense can creatively disassemble and reassemble signifiers of Westphalian sovereignty to strengthen their continuous negotiations with their metropoles and their neighbours.\nPublished in Asia Pacific Viewpoint."

    "text": "Abstract\nRugby appears to be a valuable topic allowing reading and analyzing the South African notions of space and society. Its deep cultural impact and the attachment — almost religious — that a section of the population of the country has for this sport establish it as a true symbol fraught with the social stakes of the South African nation. As a highly political topic and a particularly interesting focus for the press, rugby is discussed by elected representatives and gives rise to deep controversies over points such as skin-colour or inequalities, which are major issues for the future of the country. After 150 years of political appropriation, it has been pushed to the rank of most valuable sport for the White Afrikaner community and raises the tricky issue of identity in the context of a rainbow nation that hesitates between acknowledging the Black and coloured cultures and searching for an identification of all communities to the South African nation through sport. Rugby, that played a part in the division among the South African people, is now a particularly important element that brings to light the stakes of transformation and development that trouble the country. Indeed, discrimination, economic and social inequalities and strong oppositions that have their roots in the past and the apartheid can be found today in rugby. Sport, and firstly rugby because of the symbolism that surrounds it, can be seen as a key-sector for development and recovery policies that not only have to remedy inequality through support and practice, especially in historically disadvantaged communities, but also have to transform the picture of rugby in order to turn it into the sport of all South Africans.\nPublished in Les Cahiers d’Outre-Mer."

I understand her intervention as a fourth and pivotal conceptual moment in the study of housing markets and inequalities for the discipline of geography, for it brings racial capitalism and settler colonialism as theoretical starting points to analyse the political economy of housing in the era of digital property technologies. As such, her lecture opens up a welcome, ambitious, yet also uncertain terrain to advance global urban theory under platform capitalism and stimulate relational approaches in housing studies. Discussing the regularities through which race, technology and property shape housing and wealth inequalities across variegated sites of market-making provides a conceptual horizontality that acknowledges the United States as a testing ground, rather than a ground truth, for the production of geographical knowledge.\nPublished in Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie."
