I am an [Urban Studies Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/) at the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford. 

My research articulates two main research questions: 

- how digital technologies transform financial and real estate markets?
- how tech reshapes mechanisms of urban segregation and housing inequalities?

My current project, funded by the [Urban Studies Foundation](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/), focuses on the emergence of real estate platforms withint the South African housing market. My ongoing research focusing on South Africa. To that end, I more specifically analyse how PropTech and FinTech reshape cities and markets. 

My work lies at the intersection of economic geography, urban studies, and economic sociology. Methodologically, I combine qualitative and ethnographic research with computational tools, spatial analysis and mapping, mostly with R and QGIS.

. I previously worked on the ERC project "[Cities in Global Financial Network](https://www.citynet21.org/)" as a Research Associate in Finance and Geography. Our team authored the first *Atlas of Finance*, forthcoming at Yale University Press in September 2024.

In 2021, my [PhD dissertation](https://www.theses.fr/en/2020GRALH007) on digitalization,  financialisation and segregation in South Africa was awarded the national [Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies](http://www.urbanisme-puca.gouv.fr/prix-de-these-sur-la-ville-2021-a2141.html), and the national [Dissertation Award in Geography](https://www.cnfg.fr/vie-du-comite/prix-de-these-du-cnfg/) by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG). 

Most of my curriculum took place in France, with regular fieldwork in South Africa. I earned my MA from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), where I was a student fellow (*élève normalien*), and my PhD from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). I hold the *agrégation* of Geography. From 2017 to 2021, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [the Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en).

I am Associate Member of [St Peter's College](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/),  a regular Visiting Scholar at the [African Center for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, and Research Associate at the Research Centre [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/), where I was a doctoral candidate. Since 2023, I'm an early career representative at the [FinGeo Network](https://www.fingeo.net/).

I occasionally write and talk about the geography and sociology of rugby - a personal passion which originally brought me to South Africa.
